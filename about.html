<h3 style="font-family:Arial; color:#C443D6"><b><i>Childhood is the most beautiful phase of a person's life. Most of us have lived our childhood comfortably and joyfully. I am sure all of us have collected enough childhood memories with bittersweet nostalgia. But sadly, for some, it may remain bitter because of the deprivation basic human need- EDUCATION. We come across so many children of such deprivation on streets, roadsides, etc.</i></b></h3>

We provide them with basic health & sanitation facilities. Regular awareness drives amongst parents & children are also conducted. This is all possible because of the team efforts of SSF's volunteers, members, interns who are highly dedicated towards the upliftment of children at locations.
